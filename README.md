# Multi Object Gravity Simulator
A simple gravity simulator in python

## How to run
* Suggest IDE(like pyCharm) to run the simulation.


1. Download the latest 'tag' file and unzip it in your interpreter. If you use pyCharm, then put the file in PycharmProjects folder
2. (If using Pycharm) Go to interpreter settings and configure python interpreter ** to python version 3.8 or higher
3. Install pygame to the interpreter (version higher than pygame 2.6.0 is fine) using pip or using pycharm interpreter settings
4. Open the project folder (multi object gravity simulator)
5. Run main.py 

** If 'Invalid Python interpreter selected ...' message comes out, click on 'Configure Python interpreter' and add one! Any interpreter of Python version greater or equal to 3.8 is ok.
